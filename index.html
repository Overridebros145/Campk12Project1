      A wealthy American business magnate, playboy, philanthropist, inventor and
      ingenious scientist, Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark suffers a severe chest
      injury during a kidnapping.
    </p>
    <p>
      When his captors attempt to force him to build a weapon of mass
      destruction, he instead creates a mechanized suit of armor to save his
      life and escape captivity. Later, Stark develops his suit, adding weapons
      and other technological devices he designed through his company, Stark
      Industries. He uses the suit and successive versions to protect the world
      as Iron Man. Although at first concealing his true identity, Stark
      eventually publicly reveals himself to be Iron Man.
